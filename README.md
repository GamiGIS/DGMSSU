## Train

#### Step 1: Extract endmember bundles

Run `python extraceEMBundles.py`

#### Step 2: Segment the image into superpixels for DGMGCN and DGMSAN

Run `python SLIC_preprocess.py`

#### Step 3: Train DGMSSU

Run `python main_pytorch_CNN.py` to train the DGMCNN.

Run `python main_pytorch_GCN.py` to train the DGMGCN.

Run `python main_pytorch_SelfAttention.py` to train the DGMSAN.

## Result
  
The unmixing results will be saved at `./model_torch/DGMSSU/out/`.


## Visualization

Run `python test.py` to get  visual results.
